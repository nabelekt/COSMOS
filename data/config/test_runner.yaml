LOAD_UTILITY:
  summary: Specify a test procedure to load into Test Runner
  description: Procedures will be found automatically in the procedures directory
    or can be given by a path relative to the COSMOS install directory or by an
    absolute path.
  parameters:
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Name of the test file in quotes
      values: '.+\.rb'
RESULTS_WRITER:
  summary: Specify a different Ruby file to interpret and print the Test Runner results
  description: The specified Ruby file must define a class which implements the
    Cosmos::ResultsWriter API
  parameters:
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Name of the Ruby file which implements a result writer
      values: '.+\.rb'
    - name: Class Parameters
      required: false
      description: Parameters to pass to the constructor of the results writer
      values: .*
ALLOW_DEBUG:
  summary: Whether to allow the user to enable the debug line where the user can enter arbitrary statements
PAUSE_ON_ERROR:
  summary: Set or clear the pause on error checkbox
  description: If this is checked, Test Runner will pause if the test encounters
    an error. Otherwise the error will be logged but the script will continue.
  parameters:
    - name: Enable
      required: true
      description: Whether to pause when the script encounters an error
      values: ['TRUE', 'FALSE']
CONTINUE_TEST_CASE_AFTER_ERROR:
  summary: Set or clear the continue test case after error checkbox
  description: If this is checked, Test Runner will continue executing the current
    test case after encountering an error. Otherwise the test case will stop at
    the error and the next test case will execute.
  parameters:
    - name: Enable
      required: true
      description: Whether to continue the test case when the script encounters an error
      values: ['TRUE', 'FALSE']
ABORT_TESTING_AFTER_ERROR:
  summary: Set or clear the abort testing after error checkbox
  description: If this is checked, Test Runner will stop executing after the current
    test case completes (how it completes depends on CONTINUE_TEST_CASE_AFTER_ERROR).
    Otherwise the next test case will execute.
  parameters:
    - name: Enable
      required: true
      description: Whether to continue to the next test case when the script encounters an error
      values: ['TRUE', 'FALSE']
MANUAL:
  summary: Set the $manual global variable for all executing scripts
  description: The $manual variable can be checked during tests to allow for fully
    automated tests if it is not set, or for user input if it is set. This capability
    is completely dependent on user specific code which checks the $manual variable.
  parameters:
    - name: Enable
      required: true
      description: Whether to set the $manual global to true
      values: ['TRUE', 'FALSE']
LOOP_TESTING:
  summary: Set or clear the loop testing checkbox
  description: If this is checked, Test Runner will continue to run whatever level
    of tests that were initially started. If either "Abort Testing after Error"
    or "Break Loop after Error" are checked, then the loop testing will stop if
    an error is encountered. The difference is that the "Abort Testing after Error"
    will stop testing immediately after the current test case completes.
    "Break Loop after Error" continues the current loop by executing the remaining
    suite or group before stopping. In the case of executing a single test case
    the options effectively do the same thing.
  parameters:
    - name: Enable
      required: true
      description: Whether to loop the selected test level
      values: ['TRUE', 'FALSE']
BREAK_LOOP_AFTER_ERROR:
  summary: Set or clear the break loop after error checkbox
  description: If this is checked, Test Runner continues the current loop by
    executing the remaining suite or group before stopping.
  parameters:
    - name: Enable
      required: true
      description: Whether to break the loop after encountering an error
      values: ['TRUE', 'FALSE']
IGNORE_TEST:
  summary: Ignore the given test class name when parsing the tests
  parameters:
    - name: Test Class Name
      required: true
      description: The test class to ignore when building the list of available tests
      values: .+
IGNORE_TEST_SUITE:
  summary: Ignores the given test suite name when parsing the tests
  parameters:
    - name: Test Suite Name
      required: true
      description: The test suite to ignore when building the list of available tests
      values: .+
CREATE_DATA_PACKAGE:
  summary: Creates a data package of every file created during the test
AUTO_CYCLE_LOGS:
  summary: Automatically start a new server message log and cmd/tlm logs at the
    beginning and end of each test. Typically used in combination with CREATE_DATA_PACKAGE.
COLLECT_METADATA:
  summary: Prompt for Meta Data before starting tests
DISABLE_TEST_SUITE_START:
  summary: Disable the Test Suite Start button to prevent all tests in the Suite from running.
    This is a useful option if you're simply using Suites and Groups to organize test cases but
    do not want a user to accidentally run them all.
DISABLE_TEST_GROUP_START:
  summary: Disable the Test Group Start button to prevent all tests in the Group from running.
    This is a useful option if you're simply using Suites and Groups to organize test cases but
    do not want a user to accidentally run them all.
